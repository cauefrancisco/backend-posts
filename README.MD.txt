# # Node.JS API Using MySQL with Docker



### This is the backend for a front-end Blog project.

##### In this project I venture into creating a node API using MySql with Docker, might IO remind you I`m a front-end developer, so it might not be perfect, but it was worth it.

##### The API is used for creating, editing, updating and deleting blog posts.
